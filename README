jbotc is a simple IRC bot written in C.

Building:
	If it's your first time,
		cp defines.h{.def,}
	and then change things such as username and server/room to connect to.

	Then issue:
		make
	This builds conbot and jbot binaries.

Running:
	You can simply run
		./bin/conbot
	to have your bot loaded and connected to your defined IRC channel. conbot
	is a wrapper around jbot which connects to IRC and handles pinging. jbot is
	what actually handles all the functionality.

	If you want to test out jbot's functionality:
		./bin/jbot
	It will first print a PRIVMSG to its OWNER as a greeting. It then accepts
	standard IRC broadcast messages and responds to them. For instance if you
	type:
		:nick!user@hostmask PRIVMSG #CHANNEL_NAME :NICK: o/
	it should respond with
		PRIVMSG #CHANNEL_NAME :nick: \o
	or
		PRIVMSG #CHANNEL_NAME :nick: o/
	which would appear as a wave back in an IRC client.

Debugging:
	I've recently done a lot of work with valgrind, trying to figure out its
	mysterious ways. I believe I've failed. In any case, you can use
		valgrind ./bin/jbot
	to see if there is anything funky going on according to it.
	
	I made a suppressions file for regex functions and some internal sscanf
	things, but I believe that was all stemming from setting a pointer the
	result of malloc not initializing the pointer according to valgrind. So, my
	suggestion is don't use it.
