The testing framework cannot test multiple functions due to their random
output. Not sure what to do here, standard "random" seed? Perhaps a temprorary
sed for time(NULL) only during testing.

The testing framework should use the defines/config file instead of having
these things hardcoded into the tests if possible.

With the new regex thing, variables/keys can have spaces in them depending on
various things. When we output them, they are assumed to be space free. There
is already a TODO in the source about this.

Add special variables to the "is" function output.

Explore ways to simplify Markov. Most likely we will need custom BMap's
instead of string->string ones. If we had string->BMap and string->int
everything would be much simpler.

Allow
	NICK,
or
	NICK:
or some other varieties.

Collapse jbot_markov into one file. This will make things much simpler and we
don't have to worry about more file names. Currently, on my system, I have
over 76k of files under 4KiB, which are rounded up to taking up 301M. If they
were mashed together, they would only take a bit over 816KiB.
