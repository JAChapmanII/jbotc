The testing framework cannot test multiple functions due to their random
output. Not sure what to do here, standard "random" seed? Perhaps a temprorary
sed for time(NULL) only during testing.

The testing framework should use the defines/config file instead of having
these things hardcoded into the tests if possible.

With the new regex thing, variables/keys can have spaces in them depending on
various things. When we output them, they are assumed to be space free. There
is already a TODO in the source about this.
